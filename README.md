# rnn-text-classification-pytorch
 Project Overview
This project implements a text classification pipeline using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in PyTorch. Beyond standard model training, the core focus is an empirical study of how different hidden state aggregation methods (pooling strategies) impact final classification performance.
